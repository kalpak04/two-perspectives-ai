# **App Name**: Dual Insights

## Core Features:

- Dual Perspective Generation: The user submits a question, thought, or problem and the system will return two responses based on the following persona definitions: 'Gentle Coach' and 'No-BS Coach'. The personas are achieved via prompt engineering using the Llama2 model.
- Content Rating: Allow users to rate the generated content via a 'thumbs up' or 'thumbs down' system.
- Feedback Collection: Collect content ratings to improve future performance of the 'Dual Perspective Generation' tool.
- Input Methods: Implement text input up to 500 characters to query for two lenses in <= 5 s. Voice input (<= 30 sec); transcribe and respond in <= 7 s total.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A soft blue (#64B5F6), suggesting calmness and trustworthiness.
- Background color: A very light, desaturated blue (#E3F2FD), to provide a gentle, unobtrusive backdrop.
- Accent color: A muted purple (#9575CD), used sparingly to highlight interactive elements and key information. It is used to promote creativity.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font known for its readability and clean design, to ensure a smooth user experience.
- Use simple, clear icons. They should have rounded corners and filled style.
- Adopt a minimalistic layout with ample white space, guiding the user's eye through the content. Keep elements to a minimum.
- Subtle animations when generating the two perspectives. Animations should be brief and meaningful.
